Classroom or schoolroom is a learning space in which both children and
adults learn. Classrooms are found in educational institutions of all
kinds, ranging from preschools to universities, and may also be found in
other places where education or training is provided, such as
corporations and religious and humanitarian organizations. The classroom
provides a space where learning can take place uninterrupted by outside
distractions.
