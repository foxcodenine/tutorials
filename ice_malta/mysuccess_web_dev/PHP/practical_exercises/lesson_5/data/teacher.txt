A teacher (also called a schoolteacher or formally, an educator) is a person who helps students to acquire knowledge, competence or virtue.

Informally the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to
perform a specific task). In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out
in an informal setting, such as within the family (homeschooling), rather than in a formal setting
such as a school or college. Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching
(e.g. youth worker, pastor).

In most countries, formal teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers.
This article focuses on those who are employed, as their main role, to teach others in a formal
education context, such as at a school or other place of initial formal education or training.

A teacher's role may vary among cultures.

Teachers may provide instruction in literacy and numeracy, craftsmanship or vocational training, the
arts, religion, civics, community roles, or life skills.

Formal teaching tasks include preparing lessons according to agreed curricula, giving lessons, and
assessing pupil progress.

A teacher's professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching. Outside of the classroom teachers
may accompany students on field trips, supervise study halls, help with the organization of school
functions, and serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities. In some education systems,
teachers may be responsible for student discipline.
