/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). 

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3
games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team
scored 116, 94 and 123 points.

1. Calculate the average score for each team
2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print
   the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the
   output.
3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to
   take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)

4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and
   105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT:
   you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't
   solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)
5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping
   in mind there might be draws.

GOOD LUCK */
