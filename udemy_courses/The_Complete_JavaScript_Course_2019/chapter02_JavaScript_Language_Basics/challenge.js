Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). 

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3
games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team
scored 116, 94 and 123 points.

1. Calculate the average score for each team
2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print
   the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the
   output.
3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to
   take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)

4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and
   105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT:
   you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't
   solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)
5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping
   in mind there might be draws.

GOOD LUCK */

John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different
restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.

To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator
(as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less
than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill
is more than $200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 =
0.2)

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

/*
Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared
their BMIs. Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and
methods.
1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full
   name, mass, and height
2. Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI
   to the object and also return it from the method.
3. In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with
   the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have
   the same BMI.

Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg
and height in meter).
